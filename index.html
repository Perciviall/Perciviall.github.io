        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">If I were to ponder where I want to be in 20 years, it would be complicated ;). Jokes aside, I would be thrilled to be working full time within the aviation industry as a commercial pilot, balancing intense workloads and requirements while making time to better myself through further education. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm quite a ways off from achieving this goal of mine, but my determination continues to push me further in my flight training while ensuring I'm taking high academic workloads and enrichment opportunities such as the IB Diploma Programme, UC Santa Barbara's 2022 Summer Research Academies, and becoming a Jack Kent Cooke Young Scholar. I also seem to find my grit pushing me into enrichment activities beyond the academic, such as mock trial, model un, and of course, my flight training. 
          <br>
          <br>
          So far, I find my life following one simple philosophy: Soar forwards with empathy and grit while taking time to make the occasional mistake. Although I wouldn't describe myself as a gifted student, I love learning and enriching the experiences of myself and others on this lovely multicolored globe. Currently, I'm attending Lakewood High School with a plan to graduate through the IB Diploma Programme in 2024. Following high school I intend to pursue a higher education, with a specialization in aerospace engineering while continuing to gain more and more flight ratings and licenses. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall, I'm someone who should get more sleep and eat a little healthier, but my passion for learning and helping others pushes me forward in my goals while providing me great joy that I can help others in meaningful ways. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Feel free to reach out over anything! I'm open to talk about nearly any concept, theory, or 'thing' should you desire :)
